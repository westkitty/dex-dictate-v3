While the universe is full of wandering rocks and frozen debris, occasionally an object appears that refuses to conform to the laws of physics as we understand them, and this is the case with 3iAtlas. It may look like a comet, but it acts like something far more mysterious, and the main reason for this is what you're looking at right now. This very obvious anti-tail that is spearing out towards the sun to a distance of at least a million kilometers and perhaps even more than that. At first glance, this photograph does seem to show a standard cometary body, a glowing coma, but it's accompanied, as I said before, by this strange, collimated anti-tail, and the scales of these structures is immense. The image depicts 3iAtlas at a distance of about 300 million kilometers from Earth. Its main tail therefore extends an astonishing 5 million kilometers into the void, while the sunward-pointing anti-tail, as I mentioned before, reaches about a million kilometers. This never happens, and that's very important. Put this into perspective. If an object's measured speed was 400 meters per second, which is by the way faster than a 9mm handgun round, it would take an entire month to traverse this 1 million kilometers. But this isn't what's important. It's the physics that allows this anti-tail to exist at all. According to Avi Loeb, and there's nothing wrong with his science here, the anti-tail's ability to penetrate through the solar wind at that distance demands physics that stretch the boundaries of what we would expect from a natural comet. The solar wind at the location of 3iAtlas moves at approximately 400 kilometers per second. This is a thousand times faster than the thermal speed of gas naturally outflowing from a comet heated by the sun. Let me try to put this into perspective for you. If you wanted natural outgassing to somehow survive against that kind of solar gale, it would be the equivalent of trying to walk or run at 5 to 10 kilometers per hour straight into the teeth of a 5,000 kilometer an hour wind. Obviously impossible, and this is why natural cometary tails stream out behind a comet, not in front, and in the very rare case where an anti-tail driven by exceptionally powerful outgassing can actually survive against the solar wind, it gets annihilated within the first few hundred kilometers, at most a couple thousand, not a million. The mechanics at play here involve ram pressure, which is the force exerted by moving material pushing against stationary or slower moving material, because ram pressure scales with the square of velocity for the anti-tail to maintain its structure. By the way, this is very highly organized structure that we have observed that's lasted for days and days. Against such a fierce solar wind, the mass density must be extraordinarily high, at least a million times greater than the density of the solar wind itself. Now if this is the case, if this anti-tail is indeed comprised of a density that's a million times that of the solar wind, that means it must be losing mass at a staggering rate, approximately 200 metric tons per second for every 0.3 million kilometers squared on a side. So the anti-tail, by the way, is much bigger than 0.3 million kilometers. So when the main tail is also included in the calculation, because keep in mind this thing has an ordinary tail as well, the total mass loss over the months of October and November reaches several billion tons. This is 10% of the minimum mass that low calculated for 3iAtlas estimated at 33 billion tons. And incidentally, NASA doesn't think that this object is that big. They actually insist that the nucleus must be much smaller than 33 billion tons. But if that's the case, the entire nucleus should have been annihilated by now. And even if it wasn't, losing that much mass in a short amount of time should have shattered this object. And yet, it remains completely intact. Now the mystery gets even more confusing when you analyze 3iAtlas's movement, non-gravitational acceleration usually occurs when a comet's outgassing creates an uneven thrust, slightly altering its trajectory beyond what gravity alone would dictate. During the summer months, however, 3iAtlas showed none. It moved like a rock, or like a craft under intelligent control that was maintaining a very solid and unchanging trajectory. And then something happened. Perihelion on October 29th, at the moment that we couldn't actually see it, a measurable non-gravitational acceleration was detected. The detection is real, but the question is what's causing it. For a natural comet, the level of acceleration observed would require more than 10% of the entire object's total mass to be expelled as gas and dust. Once again, assuming the gas moves at the maximum thermal speed of 400 meters per second. Again, here's the problem. We've already accounted for at least 10% mass loss just to explain the tail and anti-tail. The math doesn't close. If 3iAtlas is a natural comet, it should have lost more mass than it started with, or it should be far larger than observations suggest. Or there is another alternative. Thermal thrusters or ion propulsion would require a lot less mass, because these types of propulsion systems have exhaust speeds that are much, much higher than thermal gas. For example, normal cometary outgassing, as I said before, travels at about 400 meters per second. Just regular chemical rocket engines travel at over 4.5 kilometers per second. That's a full order of magnitude. And if you're talking about ion thrusters accelerate charged particles to even greater velocities, it could reduce it by up to four orders of magnitude. This makes so much more sense. This explains what we are seeing, and the math ends up so much better with an artificial explanation than a natural explanation. And by the way, this evidence has been presented in more than one scholarly paper for peer review, and nobody will publish it. Every single scholarly journal refuses to even submit it for peer review, to give it a chance to hold up against criticism. They simply reject it as if we were trying to say that fairies or ghosts were changing 3iAtlas' trajectory. And the jets come with one more glaring inconsistency, and that is the fact that they are solid collimated highly organized jets, being generated by a rotating object. This should be absolutely impossible. If the jets were coming from multiple locations on the surface of 3iAtlas, as it rotates once every 16 hours, which is roughly the rotational speed that we have observed thus far, then the jets should fan out. They should not be laser-like, so the only way that a natural comet could possibly generate anything like this is if there were one location on the comet's surface that is generating the jets. And every time it's exposed to the sun during rotation, it blasts these jets out towards the sun. But if that were the case, we would be able to see the interruptions sort of a beating part of 3iAtlas every time the object rotated, and yet we're not seeing that at all. Instead, we are seeing these highly collimated, organized jets that have no interruption at all as if they were coming from an object that isn't rotating, and yet it is. And by the way, this rotation creates another mystery. The brightness of 3iAtlas seems to be varying from 10 to 20%, perhaps even more, every time it rotates. The rotation seems to change the brightness of the object. Now according to NASA, the vast, vast majority of the brightness coming from 3iAtlas is coming from its coma, which is not rotating, not from the nucleus. If that were the case, the rotation should not be changing much of anything about the brightness of the object. But as you can see from this sequence of images from Ray's astrophotography, by the way, head on over there if you've never been there before, this guy gets amazing images of 3iAtlas. You can see a very clear shift in the brightness and also the gaseous patterns that seem to exist with 3iAtlas as it rotates. That should not be happening. A cometary nucleus does not have enough gravity to drag the coma, the gas that surrounds the object with it as it rotates. And once again, even if 3iAtlas is a natural object, it is a bizarre one with anomalous behavior that should be getting a lot of coverage from the mainstream media. NASA should be glowing about this discovery, eager to find out more about this object, even if they continue to insist that it's a natural comet instead of just saying that this is some kind of new brand of coffee, something with subtly different flavor or something like that, instead of these bizarre anomalies that absolutely defy our understanding of comets and the solar wind. But instead, NASA appears to be covering things up rather than telling the public just how amazing this object is."}, {"timestamp": "2025-12-02 06:13:43", "text": "your shares, searching 22%.
